# FDOS
FDOS is a real mode DOS-like operating system written in FASM.

# Plans
So far I have a shell-like enviroment which does nothing but
ask you for input. I am planning on adding FAT12/16 support
so my bootloader would load the kernel from the disk. That
will also add the ability to use the command line to find,
load and execute programs from the disk.

# Interrupts
For a list of interrupts, their description and example
usage check out http://www.victorkindhart.com/projects/fdos/wiki.php  
Please note that it is still under construction
